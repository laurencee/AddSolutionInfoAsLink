AddSolutionInfoAsLink
=====================

A small add-in for Visual Studio 2012 that adds a SolutionInfo.cs/GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs file as a link to all non-test projects.

Very helpful when dealing with existing solutions that have a large number of projects so you don't have to perform the task by hand.
Also useful when just when adding a new project to an existing solution.
