AddSolutionInfoAsLink
=====================

A small add-in for **Visual Studio 2012** that adds a SolutionInfo.cs/GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs file **as a link** to all non-test projects.

Very helpful when dealing with existing solutions that have a large number of projects.
Also useful just when adding a new project to an existing solution.

#Pre-requisite

Have a **SolutionInfo.cs** or **GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs** file already added somewhere in your solution. (Usually just included as a solution item)
